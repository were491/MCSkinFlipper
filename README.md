# MCSkinFlipper
Flips your skin to make it backwards. I made this a year and a half ago (New years' 2020) to troll people on servers (it really works!) since I couldn't find a working automatic skin flipper at the time. I think there are some now but whatever. Either way this is basically a macro so I'm never fixing my terrible code.

Used [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/) for converting the .py file.
